When collaborating with others, each person inevitably holds their own unique mental image of the same project, often subtly or significantly differing from everyone else's. Even in daily interactions, identical words can mean different things to different people, creating hidden misunderstandings.

Therefore, effectively working with others isn't just about task management, it's fundamentally about answering:

**How can everyone clearly see and feel the same creative vision simultaneously?**

The single most effective solution to this is **prototyping**.

### What is Prototyping? 

Prototyping involves quickly creating simplified, tangible versions of ideas or concepts to explore, test, refine and align them with reality.

Here's the simple prototyping cycle:

1. **Idea**: Clearly state the concept
2. **Prototype:** Create a basic, tangible version
3. **Feedback:** Test assumptions and observe interactions
4. **Iterate:** Refine based on insights and then repeat.

Prototyping is especially powerful because, unlike a brief, it allows interaction with real-world conditions, revealing hidden issues, and aligning everyone around a shared, visible reality.

### Real World Examples: New Demos 

##### Prototype 1: Concept Validation (Tweet) 

The first prototype of the concept that would later become [[New Demos]] was a tweet:

![[https://x.com/internetvin/status/1727759489351200849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1727759489351200849%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=]]

This tweet specifically tested:

- Whether there was interest in a monthly event series with a focus on technology and creative communities.
- Key components people responded to positively, demos, rules, voting, cash prizes, and gathering in Roncesvalles.

Publishing this tweet allowed direct observation and feedback. With significant engagement (54.6k views), it validated the demand and confirmed the potential excitement around this idea.

##### Prototype 2: New Demos 1 (Physical Event) 

Using insights from the tweet prototype, the first physical event named "[New Demos](https://publish.obsidian.md/new/New/New+Demos)"  
was created.

- We secured a venue in Roncesvalles and sponsorship from local companies.
- Tommy joined to help specifically with logistic and planning the event.
- Regular updates were shared online to build anticipation and gather feedback.

Outcomes included:

**Successes:**

- The venue reached full capacity with approximately 100 attendees.
- Online feedback after the event was consistently positive, highlighting the quality of presentations and the sense of community.
- [Vin](https://publish.obsidian.md/new/Vin), [Tommy](https://publish.obsidian.md/new/Tommy), and [Vince](https://publish.obsidian.md/new/Vince) were able to discover a comedic banter, that included making jokes, or using the sound effects from the Rodecaster Pro during the demos. Comedy would become a core element of projects going forward.

**Challenges:**

- Technical difficulties occurred, including issues with the projector, especially on the first demo, and transitions between speakers.
- The event heavily skewed towards tech demos, lacking sufficient representation from creative fields.
- The audience consistent predominantly of men, highlighting a need for greater gender diversity.

##### Prototype 3: New Demos 2 (Enhanced Event) 

In direct response to the challenges identified in the first event, the next prototype event was designed with specific improvements:

- It was held at Revue Cinema, dramatically improving the audio and visual experience for the presenters and the audience.
- The event integrated comedic and visually engaging elements, such as a prominently featured 3D spinning Jamaican Beef Patty.
- A more balanced selection of demos, including greater representation of creative fields along side tech.
- Active outreach efforts were made to improve audience gener diversity, resulting in a more balanced attendance.

Insights from this event confirmed the effectiveness of specific improvements, particularly the impact of high-quality AV, balanced content, distinctive art direction, and active diversity outreach.

#### Common Misunderstandings 

- **"Prototyping is random tinkering"** - Prototyping involves deliberate experiments designed to answer specific questions.
- **"Prototyping is time consuming"** - Effective prototyping is intentionally quick and iterative.
- **"Prototyping must be perfect"** - Early prototypes should be simple, prioritizing learning and clarity.

New Builds reimagines the traditional hackathon by combining intensive 48-hour project development with a sports-style draft for team formation. This approach encourages cross-pollination of skills and perspectives across Toronto's tech ecosystem.

# How It Works 

Pre-selected team captains draft team members from a group of qualified participants. Each participant is anonymized but shows their skills and a fun catchphrase. Captains use this info to draft their optimal 4 person team, like picking players in fantasy sports. After the draft, teams have 48 hours to build and present their projects.

# Why We Did This 

Traditional hackathons in Toronto (and beyond) have become predictable and in ways, low stakes. The same people form teams with their friends, and many talented developers and designers have stopped attending because they find them uninteresting.

We wanted to attempt to mix things up, increase the stakes, and see if we could get people collaborating across different networks, while also bridging the Toronto and Waterloo communities.

# What Happened 

The draft format was very successful. It broke people out of their usual circles and created both more diverse teams and also more diverse projects. People who hadn't been to hackathons in years decided to show up because it felt like something new and special.

The formal attire draft night at the Ace Hotel, along with how we developed narratives through player cards, art direction, and unique artifacts generated a lot of social media attention, which then further raised the stakes of the experience.

Championship rings were created for the winning team, adding to the competitive atmosphere and giving winners something meaningful to take home.

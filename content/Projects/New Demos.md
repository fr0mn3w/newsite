[New Demos](https://www.newdemos.ca/) is an event series in Toronto that showcases unique creations across art, technology, games, food, and more.

### How It Works 

Creators present their works-in-progress in a movie theatre setting designed to put clear focus on the work. Each demo is staged intentionally using visuals, sound, and atmosphere to make the work memorable and engaging.

Works are thematically grouped, with Toronto's culture woven throughout the experience.

### Why We Did This 

Creative work deserves focused presentation, but most mediums rarely get it. While a painting might find its way to a gallery, when do you see software presented with intentional focus on every detail? Or experience a chef's creative process with full attention on their thinking?

A movie theatre offers complete immersion, perfect acoustics, large screen visibility, and an audience primed to pay attention. It transforms how work is experienced and understood.

We also wanted to blend multiple disciplines into one experience and celebrate Toronto's culture by bringing together different creative and technical communities that wouldn't usually mix. By combining art, technology, games, food, and more into a single event, we create opportunities for cross-pollination where ideas from different fields can collide and inspire each other.

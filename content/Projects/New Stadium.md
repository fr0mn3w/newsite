New Stadium is our physical presence located on 83 Walnut Avenue, Toronto.

The environment designed to improve how people learn and make new things. It focuses on two processes:

1. How fast individuals or groups can gain knowledge.
2. How well they can turn that knowledge into concrete outcomes.

It responds to a problem: traditional setups (schools, workplaces, coffee shops, co-working spaces) don't match today's pace of change, information volume, and technology. New Stadium rethinks the context people work in to address that.
